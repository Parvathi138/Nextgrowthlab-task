Delivery is often more than 30 days and up to 55 days. Dispute is handled by robot and no real people behind it. Return shipping for faulty item is paid by the buyer and most of the time is expensive and not worth it. The price published for a product is often based on the lowest forex rate so that the item look cheaper. So many manipulations inside this platform.
